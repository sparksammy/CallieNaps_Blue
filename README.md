"The best way to hax is to think simple, yet outside the box at the same time." --Samuel Lord

Note: Made for macOS, and made for building on Ubuntu WSL.
Note 2: I ***do not*** own the files in Lua/ and ***I didn't*** make the files in calamari-ios-mods/ myself, hence the name.

## How does it work?
It uses a custom LUA VM to put code into ROBLOX's engine that allows you to run custom code once the ELF is injected. (Shoutouts to cloristonezar for making Calamari for iOS under GPL, your work is in a seperate directory called "calamari-ios-mods")
