Note: This now uses Mac compilation.

## How does it work?
It uses a simple (semi-custom?) LUA VM to put code into ROBLOX's engine that allows you to execute pre-built commands once the .SO is injected.

## Dependencies?
Hint: brew install lua@5.1

## Could this work in iOS?
Maybe, if someone were to fork it, yes. It *is* heavily inspired by Calamari (The ROBLOX scripting tool, not the squid.) and Custom Lua VM (but just without some of the the custom), so maybe.

## What about Windows 10?
If someone forked it, replaced the bypass code with this: https://github.com/sparksammy/ReturnCheck and compiled/linked it in Visual Studio as a DLL, maybe.
