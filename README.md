"The best way to hax is to think simple, yet outside the box at the same time, but use the right tools." --Samuel Lord, 2021

Note: This now uses Mac compilation as of June 12th 2021 at 7pm central time. Also, this is MY project, and so far, has 0 affiliation with Jellyfish. Enjoy, and feel free to contribute as long as you follow the SparksammyCOC as well as the LICENSE.

## How does it work?
It uses a simple (semi-custom?) LUA VM to put code into ROBLOX's engine that allows you to execute pre-built commands once the .dylib is injected. Please note this mostly 

## Dependencies?
Hint: brew install lua@5.1

## Could this work in iOS?
Maybe, if someone were to fork it, yes. It *is* heavily inspired by Calamari (The ROBLOX scripting tool, not the squid.) and Custom Lua VM (but just without some of the the custom), so maybe.

## What about Windows 10?
If someone forked it, replaced the bypass code with this: https://github.com/sparksammy/ReturnCheck and compiled/linked it in Visual Studio as a DLL, maybe.

## What's the point of the RetCheck port/Bypass code?
Just in case ROBLOX EVER DOES obtain a port of VMProtect to Mac (which means VMProtect creators could port it to Linux pretty easily but to my understanding that's why ROBLOX doesn't have a Linux port, besides lack of market share and other stuff.) I would be ready.

## Credits
**Sparksammy** - Creating the hack, interface, as well as converting Valcrax's bypass to (hopefully compatible) Mac code.
**Valcrax** - Did most of the work creating the bypass
**Marie** - Releasing the Calamari source code to give me inspiration...
